.SH NAME
analyticsd \- analyse parts of syslog and uplaod certain events to Google
Analytics
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B analyticsd [--tid
.I tracking-id
.B ] [
.I --daemon
.B ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B analyticsd
is a system daemon that analyses syslog messages to send events to Google
Analytics. The daemon will tail common log files and parse lines with regular
expressions. Matching lines, e.g. failed SSH logins, are transformed into
events and sent via the Measurement Protocol.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP --tid
Set the Tracking ID to associate with events. The default is not set, so events
will not be tracked after being sent.
.IP --daemon
Launch
.B analyticsd
in the background, as a daemon. This will also update its PID file (typically
in /var/run/).
.SH EXAMPLES
The daemon will not spawn into the background by default and you'll have to
give it a Tracking ID. A typical command line looks like this:
.IP "analyticsd --tid UA-XXXXX-Y --daemon"
This sets the Tracking ID to
.B UA-XXXXX-Y
and spawns the programme in the background.
